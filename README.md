## 🚀 Projects

### 🧊 Still Tasty
**Role:** Back-End Developer  
Still Tasty is a virtual fridge and pantry manager that tracks food expiration dates and helps users plan groceries with ease. A calendar view enables quick overview of expiring items.  
I developed the data model architecture for efficient food storage and shopping list generation.

**Role:** Solo Developer  
Safe Place helps users quickly locate nearby police stations and call for help via geolocation. It also supports FaceTime calls to trusted contacts while keeping the map visible.  
The app was fully designed and built by me, integrating MapKit and CoreLocation for real-time location services.
